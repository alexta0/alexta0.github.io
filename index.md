<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

  Currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), I am collaborating with 
  [Dmitry Petrov](https://lodurality.github.io/) and 
  [Prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/) on geometric editing of images and 3D shapes generated by diffusion processes. 
  Before embarking on my graduate journey, I worked as a graphics engineer at Fields Lab of Huawei, and previously, 
  I obtained a first-class honours degree in applied mathematics from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). 
  There, I had the privilege to be mentored by 
  [Prof. Eduardo G. Altman](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/ega/), focusing on [topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) beyond textual data, specifically using 
  [Multilayer Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_network#Definition) and 
  [Bayesian Stochastic Block Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10225).
