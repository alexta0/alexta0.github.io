  <!-- Currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), I am collaborating with 
  [Dmitry Petrov](https://lodurality.github.io/) and 
  [Prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/) on geometric editing of images and 3D shapes generated by diffusion processes. 
  Before embarking on my graduate journey, I worked as a graphics engineer at Fields Lab of Huawei, and previously, 
  I obtained a first-class honours degree in applied mathematics from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). 
  There, I had the privilege to be mentored by 
  [Prof. Eduardo G. Altman](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/ega/), focusing on [topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) beyond textual data, specifically using 
  [Multilayer Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_network#Definition) and 
  [Bayesian Stochastic Block Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10225). -->

I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Eduardo G. Altman](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/ega/) and Prof. [Tristram Alexander](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/tristram-alexander.html). My research focuses on developing methodological approaches to uncover meso-scale structures in complex networks.

I graduated with first-class honours in Applied Mathematics from The University of Sydney in 2019, where my research explored topic modeling and community detection in complex systems. After completing my undergraduate studies, I worked as a software engineer at Huawei for two years, gaining practical experience in software development and large-scale data analysis. I then pursued a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), where I conducted research in deep learning under the supervision of [Prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/) and [Dmitry Petrov](https://lodurality.github.io/), focusing on applications in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and graphics.
