<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, I collaborate with [Dmitry Petrov](https://lodurality.github.io/) and Prof. [Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/) on the geometric editing of images and 3D shapes generated by diffusion processes. Before embarking on my graduate journey, I worked as a graphics engineer at Huawei. Previously, I obtained first-class Honours degree in applied mathematics from the University of Sydney, where I had the privilege of being mentored by Prof. [Eduardo G. Altman](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/ega/), working on the topic modeling problem beyond textual data based on Multilayer Networks and Stochastic Block Models.
