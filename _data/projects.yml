    descriptions: The key contribution of the project is its novel approach to the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/P19-1096/">ECPE</a> task through several methods, such as 1) framing the problem as a multi-span extractive question-answering problem, 2) evaluating the performance of LLMs on this task, and 3) recreating SOTA frameworks in Pytorch that were originally crafted in TensorFlow 1.x.

    date: 2019
    descriptions: The thesis's main contribution is enhancing the network model with additional textual information, improving the classification of documents. Experiments on Wikipedia articles confirm that incorporating auxiliary information into topic models results in a better fit to the data and superior document classification.
